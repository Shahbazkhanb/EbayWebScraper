# Ebay Web Scraper

Here I tried my first hand at using Python's Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape product info for items listed on ebay.com  
The inspiration for this project came from this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4hEAhHHykI) and i tried to add my own flair.  
  
The program will ask what item you want to search for on Ebay, scrape the information (item title, currency item is in, pricce of item and number sold) for the first 20 pages of results and then compile them to a file location that you specify.
